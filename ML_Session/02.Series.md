## Basic Six Elements

1. Data — {Available Everywhere, the main component}
2. Tasks — { insights of Data, learn a relatioship b/w X & Y}
3. Models — { Approximate mathematical Function for task}
4. Loss Function — { Minimize the error, Which model is better?}
5. Learning Algorithm — { train the system to produce approximate model}
6. Evaluation — {How well your model works?}

## Questions
1. Difference with ML & DL
> Understand Different Jargons [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMGt-jcMlCs)
> - Artificial Intelligence - Intelligence to Machine (General vs Narrow)
    1. __Abilities__ - Computer Vision, Speech, Natural Language Processing, Planning & Decision Making
    2. __Tasks__ - Object classification and boundaries, speech recognition, face recognition, spam detection, self driving cars, Game play, robotics
    3. __Methods__ 
        - Exper System
        - Machine Learning - Regression models, graphical models
        - Deep Learning - Family of ML Algo. RNN, CNN etc.. for complex models on large data set. (Can be used in ML use cases also)
        - Re enforced Learning  
        Expert
> - Data Science -
> - Machine Learning- Computers system's ability to __learn__ with data using __statistical technique__ without being explicitly programmed.
> Deep Learning - One hammer for many tasks
2. Publishing model, how to put in api?
> _In Python it works as follows_
> - Serialize the model to a file (pickling)
> - Deserialize(load) the model to memory and use in API business logic
> Reference [Datacamp ML model to API](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-models-api-python)
>
> Straight away using Python models in C#, or Java is not possible.
> [StackOverflow Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47931716/how-to-use-a-scikit-learn-model-from-c-sharp)
> - Predictive Model Markup Language ([PMML](http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-3/GeneralStructure.html)) is interchange formal 
> - Expose as API or call python process from your language. [Reference](https://medium.com/@ernest.bonat/using-c-to-run-python-scripts-with-machine-learning-models-a82cff74b027)
